# Source2Gen

Source2Gen is a tool to generate Source 2 SDKs. \
This project aims to provide an easy way to generate SDKs for various Source 2 games. \
An example of such SDKs could be found at [source2sdk](https://github.com/neverlosecc/source2sdk/tree/cs2).

---

## Usage

Open the source2gen-loader binary, it will automatically(if supported) find the game path,
and it will also set up the needed environment

### Windows

```commandline
source2gen-loader.exe
```

### Linux

```sh
./scripts/run.sh "$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/cs2/"
# view generated sdk
ls ./sdk
```

You can also invoke source2gen directly , e.g. for debugging, by running

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/cs2/game/bin/linuxsteamrt64/:$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/cs2/game/csgo/bin/linuxsteamrt64/ \
  source2gen
```

Source2Gen for Linux support is currently in an alpha state. There will be
errors, bugs, and wrong output. Please only file issues if you want to work on
them. This note will be removed once we have thoroughly tested Source2Gen on
Linux.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

#### Windows

- Visual Studio 2019 or newer
- CMake

#### Linux

- g++-13 or newer
- CMake

### Clone the repository

To clone the repository with submodules, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/neverlosecc/source2gen.git
```

### Update the Game Definition

Before building the project in Visual Studio, you will need to update the game definition.
The default definition is `CS2`. \
Possible options are: `CS2`, `SBOX`, `ARTIFACT2`, `ARTIFACT1`, `DOTA2`, `UNDERLORDS`, `DESKJOB`, `DEADLOCK`.

When using CMake, you can set `cmake -DSOURCE2GEN_GAME=CS2`
